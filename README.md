# BeAware, The Deaf Assistant for iPhones

Everyday Angela goes to high school by public transport in Detroit, and her hearing disability never affected her.
Then one day, her mom heard the story about her classmate, a girl who got assaulted.
Because of that, Angela's mom became more anxious for her deaf daughter’s well being.
Ever since then she began to look for possible solutions, but they were all too expensive or unpopular to trust.

We have over 600k deaf or head of hearing residents in Michigan now! Isn’t that unbelievable? 
600k deaf/hard of hearing people! That’s 1 person of for every 3 households in every city in every neighborhood, and also includes babies and their mothers.

Introducing BeAware, an assistant for the deaf and hard of hearing.

Now with BeAware, when Jacob is delivering packages, thanks to the Alert functionality, he’s finally alerted of any emergency sirens blaring while he’s driving, so he can pull to the side.
And, when Matt goes to the store to pick up his groceries, he doesn’t need special assistance to communicate thanks to the emoji board.

We believe that people with passion can change the world. And we believe that in this world, people can change it for the better. Let’s bring BeAware to life, and enable those believers.

So when Grandma Gina is looking after her grandkids, she knows exactly when the babies need attention. We want people like her to not even realize that they’re deaf.
